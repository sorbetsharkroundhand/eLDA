# eLDA
---

Precautions: Due to potential pydub library errors and possible environmental differences, please ensure to run this in Google Colab.


Place the all folder and file in your drive.
Run the eLDA.ipynb file inside the unzipped 240620-LR folder in the Colab environment.

Steps 1-3 can be set to execute sequentially by running the cells in order.

1. Mount Google Colab.

2. Since pydub might not be a built-in library in Google Colab, please install it using the pip install command written in the ipynb cell.

3. Import the libraries required for model implementation.

4. Enter the path of the 240620-LR folder in the your_path variable. For example, your_path = **'/content/drive/MyDrive/'yourfolder''**. Copy and paste the path of the folder accordingly.

5. Execute from the top in order to check the eLDA results.

In other words, once the path is set, you can run all the cells to get the results.
